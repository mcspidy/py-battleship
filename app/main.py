This module implements a simple Battleship game.

Classes:
    Deck: Represents a single deck (cell) of a ship.
    Ship: Represents a ship composed of multiple decks.
    Battleship: Represents the game board and manages the ships and firing
        logic.

Deck:
    Methods:
        __init__(row: int, column: int, is_alive: bool = True): Initializes a
            deck with its position and status.

Ship:
    Methods:
        __init__(start: tuple, end: tuple, is_drowned: bool = False):
            Initializes a ship with its start and end coordinates.
        build_decks(start: tuple, end: tuple) -> list: Static method to create
            a list of decks for the ship.
        get_deck(row: int, column: int) -> Deck: Finds and returns the deck at
            the specified position.
        fire(row: int, column: int) -> None: Changes the `is_alive` status of
            the deck and updates the `is_drowned` status if needed.

Battleship:
    Methods:
        __init__(ships: list) -> None: Initializes the game board with the
            given ships.
        place_ships(ships: list) -> dict: Static method to create a dictionary
            of ship positions.
        fire(location: tuple) -> str: Checks if the given location hits a ship
            and updates the ship's status accordingly.
